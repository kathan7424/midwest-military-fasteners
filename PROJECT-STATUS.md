## Styling / Brand

|------|--------|-------|

| Brand color tokens in CSS | ✅ Done | `@theme` tokens: navy, amber, blue, near-black, grays, etc. |

---

## Shared UI (`components/shared_Ui/`) — reused across pages

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `Breadcrumb.tsx` | Generic breadcrumb (items array; last = bold current page) |
| `IsoSection.tsx` | ISO 9001:2015 trust block; `align="left" \| "center"` prop; matches old Footer styling |
| `QtyAddToOrder.tsx` | QTY input + Add to Order button; `size="sm"` (table rows) / `"lg"` (detail) |

ISO note: the ISO block was removed from `Footer.tsx` and is now rendered per page via `<IsoSection />` — centered on Home, left-aligned + bottom-aligned (`mt-auto`) on the product pages.

---

## Product Listing Page (`/product`) — 2026-07-01

Full frontend build of the Hex Cap Screws (MS35307) catalog view. **Data is mock** — ready for backend to wire to API/CMS.

### Features
| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Responsive layout | ✅ Done | Desktop sidebar + main; mobile/tablet collapses into slide-out Sheet drawer |
| Accordion category sidebar | ✅ Done | SCREWS / NUTS / WASHERS → expandable groups → part-series links + active state |
| Product data table | ✅ Done | Sortable P/N (links to detail), description, 1/3/5/10 Pkg pricing, MFR, country, spec download, QTY + Add to Order |
| Client-side filter | ✅ Done | Live text filter over P/N + description |
| ISO 9001:2015 section | ✅ Done | Shared `<IsoSection align="left" />`, bottom-aligned |
| Route wiring | ✅ Done | `src/app/(website)/product/page.tsx` |

---

## Product Detail Page (`/product/[series]/[partNumber]`) — 2026-07-01

Single-product detail view (e.g. `/product/MS35307/MS35307-303`). **Frontend + mock data only** — backend wires real API later.

### Features
| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Nested dynamic route | ✅ Done | `[series]/[partNumber]`; `getProductByPartNumber()` lookup + `notFound()` fallback |
| Responsive sidebar shell | ✅ Done | Same desktop sidebar + mobile Sheet drawer as listing |
| Hero (title / description / image) | ✅ Done | Image fixed at 298×199 per Figma |
| QTY + Add to Order (lg) | ✅ Done | 2px `#4F5965` border, 20px condensed button — matches Figma |
| Vertical spec table | ✅ Done | P/N, SKU, Description, Pkg Qty, 1/3/5/10 Pkg, MFR, Spec Sheet (download + legacy note); blue (#336699) label column |
| ISO 9001:2015 section | ✅ Done | Shared `<IsoSection align="left" />`, bottom-aligned |
| Listing → detail navigation | ✅ Done | Listing P/N cell now links to the detail route |

### Components created (Product Detail + Sidebar)
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/app/(website)/product/[series]/[partNumber]/page.tsx` | Detail route (async params) |
| `src/components/pages/ProductDetail/ProductDetailPage.tsx` | Composes sidebar + hero + QTY/order + spec table + ISO |
| `src/components/pages/ProductDetail/ProductSpecTable.tsx` | Vertical spec table |
| `src/components/pages/ProductDetail/index.ts` | Barrel exports |
| `src/components/pages/Product/productData.ts` | Shared mock data (`MOCK_PRODUCTS`, `HERO`) + `getProductByPartNumber()` |
| `src/components/ui/accordion.tsx` / `table.tsx` / `data-table.tsx` / `sheet.tsx` / `button.tsx` | shadcn primitives + custom DataTable |
| `src/components/layout/Sidebar/*` | `Sidebar`, `SidebarGroup`, `SidebarItem`, `sidebarData.ts`, `types.ts` |

### Data model
- `Product` type gained a `sku` field; mock data centralized in `productData.ts`.

## Environment Notes

- ⚠️ `NODE_ENV=production` is set machine-wide on the current dev environment. This makes npm run with `omit=dev`, so a plain `npm install` **strips devDependencies** (`@tailwindcss/postcss`, `tailwindcss`, `typescript`, `@types/node`) and breaks the build. **Always install with `npm install --include=dev`** (or remove the global `NODE_ENV`).
- One pre-existing TypeScript error remains in `Loginheader.tsx` (Promise/MenuItem typing) — unrelated to the product pages.

---

## Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Cart store + Add to Order wiring** — Zustand store, wire listing/detail buttons, header order-count badge *(deferred from this pass)*
2. **Build Cart page** (`/cart`) — line items, QTY, remove, tax-exemption banner, Checkout *(deferred)*
3. **Wire `/product` + detail to real data** — replace `MOCK_PRODUCTS` / `SIDEBAR_DATA` with WC/API data
4. **Fix Header responsiveness** — verify hamburger menu + `hidden md:flex` on Navbar
5. **Build Homepage** — implement full Figma Home page design
6. **Build Login/Register page** — auth flow
